# Some Assembly Required

("irrelevant" upside-down house, interpret as you will)

(It doesn&rsquo;t really matter exactly how or where the data goes but,) the
rsync&rsquo;d [data from GovTrack](https://www.govtrack.us/developers/data) goes
here with the per-congress directories being stored at this level.

**Note:** this is relatively temporary because it is imported into the database
and thats where the magic happens. This is just a local/"master" copy of the
data to refer back to or pre-process before importing into MySQL.

~~So far (as of commit ca0413b419969379bc186dc5f3715907dffce75c) we only use the
data in `<congress>/bills/hr/` and `<congress>/bills/s/` aka bills, not
resolutions.~~ (no longer true as of commit
f5908f59aea080b76932f532ea4d5486ad4345ce, now all bills and resolutions are used)

Example with the 113rd Congress (2013-14):
